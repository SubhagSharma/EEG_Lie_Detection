Deception detection has long been a challenge, with both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, it serves justice by identifying dishonest individuals, while on the negative side, some techniques employed have raised ethical concerns and violated human rights and international agreements. Throughout history, the methods for lie detection, commonly referred to as deceit identification, have been subject to scrutiny, leading to ongoing discussions.

Recent advancements in machine learning have opened up new possibilities for tackling this issue. This paper explores various supervised learning approaches aimed at identifying deception. In supervised learning, datasets with labeled deception information are used, and the study aims to establish a foundational set of parameters for Lie Detection (LD). This research strives to achieve accuracy levels exceeding 70%, making it comparable to human performance in gathering information for deceit identification.
